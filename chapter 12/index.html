    <h5>FLORENTINA STEAK</h5>
    <P><b>A</b> bistecca florentina, or florentine t-bone steak,covers all of the characteristics of itlay's best dishes:a specific cut of meat from a specific cow prepared in a very specific way all within the confines of a specific region. In the case of the enormous bistecca florentine, it's a t-bone steak cut thick (atleast five cm) from the lion of a <a>chaining cow</a> in tuscany.It's cooked for 5 to 10 mins on each side, depending on the thicknes, until the outside is cooked and the inside remains very rare.No sense in asking for a medium-well done steak here,the meat is to thick to even thick about it!</P>
    <h5>LASANGNA</h5>
    <p><b>L</b>asangna is a white, flat pasta noodle, usually baked in layers in the oven. Like most italian dishes, its origins are hottly contested, but we can atleast say thats its strong hold is in the region of emilia-romagna,where it transform from a poor men food to a rich meal filled with the <a>ragu</a>, or made sauce traditionally lasagna was made with tomatoes(remember, those came over from the new world in this 16th century):only ragu,bechamel sauce and cheese , usually mozeralla or <a>parmigino reggiano</a> or a combination of two.Even today, only a bit of tomato or tomato sauce is used in a tradition ragu until most italian- american dishes , which are basically swimming in the tomato sauce.This concentrate the floavour of the meat but sometimes in a little jarring for american palates</p>
    <h5>TRUFFLES</h5>
        <p><b>I</b>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <a>Lorem Ipsum</a> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
